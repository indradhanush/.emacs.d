My Emacs Config
===

This is my config for Emacs 25.1.1. Works best on OSX, but should work on Linux as well.

##Usage:##

```
cd ~

# Backup your existing config 
mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.backup

# Clone the repo

git clone git@github.com:indradhanush/.emacs.d.git .emacs.d
```

The configs use `use-package` and they will be installed on the fly.

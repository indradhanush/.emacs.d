Emacs Config
===

This is my config for Emacs 25.1.1. Works best on OSX, but should work
on Linux as well.

**Usage:**

```
cd ~

# Backup your existing config 
mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.backup

# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/indradhanush/.emacs.d.git
```

The configs use `use-package` and the packages will be installed on
the fly.

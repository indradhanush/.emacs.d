My Emacs Config
===

This is my emacs config for Mac OS X. Will work also on Linux boxes.

##Usage:##

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:indradhanush/Emacs.git
mv Emacs/ .emacs.d
```

Search for `/Users/dhanush/` and replace it with your `$HOME`.

Enjoy!

###Note for Linux users:###

You can comment out `(setq save-interprogram-paste-before-kill nil)` as its a bug fix for Mac exclusively.
